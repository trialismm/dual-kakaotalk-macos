# Feasibility and CoreUI Decision
[한국어](FEASIBILITY.md) | [English](FEASIBILITY.en.md)

Status: **EXPERIMENTAL BETA — PRIVATE API, FINGERPRINT-GATED**

## Verified baseline

The Intel verification machine runs macOS 13.7.8 (22H730). Its official KakaoTalk 26.6.1 (1190) has bundle identifier `com.kakao.KakaoTalkMac`, Team ID `L75WVXX68A`, a valid strict deep signature, and a Universal x86_64/arm64 executable. Exact non-asset compatibility facts are recorded in `compatibility.json`.

Dock icon pixel replacement is unsupported because of code-signing constraints and macOS runtime icon selection. The dual app is instead labeled `Dual KakaoTalk` in the Dock and app switcher. Its green menu-bar states reside in `Contents/Resources/Assets.car`; macOS provides no public writer API for that compiled format.

## Current implementation

The project owner explicitly accepted the private-API risk. The beta therefore uses a small Objective-C bridge to undocumented CoreUI classes. It:

- accepts only an exact allowlisted source-catalog SHA-256;
- addresses only eight named menu icons at 1x and 2x;
- checks expected dimensions and link structure before mutation;
- patches a staged copy, never the official app;
- validates the resulting catalog and requires its hash to change;
- signs and verifies the completed staged app before replacement;
- rolls back the prior `KakaoTalkWork.app` on failure.

The bridge declarations are independently implemented from observed runtime selectors and MIT-licensed CoreUI header information. No third-party implementation, Kakao executable, or Kakao asset bytes are vendored.

## Residual risk

CoreUI is private and may change in any macOS update. Catalog internals may change in any KakaoTalk update. Ad-hoc signing can trigger security prompts. The Universal output is physically verified on Intel macOS 13.7.8 and Apple M3 macOS 26.5.2; other combinations remain experimental. Every unknown catalog fails closed and is reported through the compatibility issue flow.

## Follow-up

A separately tracked goal researches an independent writer for only the required `Assets.car` subset. It must preserve non-target records byte-for-byte where possible, provide round-trip and corruption tests, and replace the private bridge only after parity is demonstrated. Until then, the private bridge remains clearly labeled experimental.
